This file contains the list of features and bugs currently in progress or
consideration. If you are currently working on a task, add your name to it.

GuestTracker is currently still a student project for a grade, so these
entries are still needed to get the full grade:

* Use Bans
	Bans are currently not used when checking in a person.
* Help Docs - trever
	A complete help system stored in the database, with translations
	possible.
* Check out entries
	Checking out a guest should be at most a search for their name
	and a click on a 'checkout' link.
* Admin pages
	* ACLs
	* Groups
	* Residents
	* Bans
	* Card types
	* Various settings
* REST interface
	A REST interface would make a fat GUI client easily possible

The rest of these things need to be done before the first release (1.0):

* AJAX search widget
* View methods - adam
	* Building
	* Entry
	* Message
* MOTD
* Building::viewRoom method
* AJAX checkin widget
* Pagination
* Shell jobs
	* Checkout old entries (configurable)
* Quick resident verification

These items should be in a future release:

* Equipment/computer lab key checkout
* Messaging system
	* Thread-like view
* Scheduling
	* iCal export
